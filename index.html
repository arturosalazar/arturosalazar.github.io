        <h3 class="heading">Welcome to my Landing Page!</h3>
        <p>This is where I hope to host my work as I work on building up my portfolio. Currently I'm working on teaching myself web development. At the moment, my main focus is on HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript. As I develop my skills I'll work on adding more to this page. For now, you can view my <a href="https://github.com/arturosalazar">Github</a> to take a look at some of the projects and exercises I've already completed. Thanks again for visitng!</p>

        <h3 id="first-post" class="heading">JavaScript</h3>
        <p>I'm currently working through the exercises in <a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/">Eloquent JavaScript</a> to develop a strong understanding of JavaScript as well as Node.js (which is covered in the last portion of the book). On top of this, I have worked on <a href="https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript">Practical JavaScript</a> and <a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/arturosalazar">Code Wars</a> exercises</p>

        <p>I've been working on the introductory HTML and CSS course on <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css">Khan Academy</a></p>
